A subclass of UITextField that recognizes hashtags, @-mentions and relations (<>).

Simply run the emulator and start typing away.

Current issues:

Highlighting works only when autocompletion is in progress. Completed autocompletions are un-highlighted.
Relation autocompletion needs to be revisited regarding the formatting, it is probably currently wrong.
